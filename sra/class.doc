                         TYMNET CLASSES


1  WHAT IS A CLASS?


A Class defines a set of nodes and/or hosts in a TYMNET network.
A TYMNET network Supervisor may use defined Classes when checking
that  a  username's  logon  request  may originate from  a  given
location.


2  WHY DO WE NEED CLASSES?


There are four reasons why it may be desirable to define a Class.

    -  Pricing Structure and accounting

    -  Security, both for the Network(s) and our subscribers.

    -  Legal (regulatory) requirements.

    -  Administrative convenience


3  HOW ARE CLASSES DEFINED?


Classes are  defined through NETVAL and reside as data structures
on the network Supervisor(s).

NETVAL allows Classes to be composed from one or more CATEGORIES.
A category contains a list of nodes or hosts and is identified by
a  short  mnemonic.   Node categories  can  be  mixed  with  host
categories  when  a  Class is defined.  A category may be used in
different class definitions as required.

Classes that  allow  access  from  the  component  categories are
called INCLUSION Classes.

It is sometimes more expedient  to define an EXCLUSION Class that
will  allow  access   from  everywhere  EXCLUDING  the  locations
specified in the component categories.  Class 4 is an  example of
an EXCLUSION class.




                              - 3 -






On  Public  Tymnet,  the  Validations  group  is  responsible for
maintaining the Class tables through NETVAL.    Validations works
closely with other groups when planning Class table changes.


4  USERNAME PROFILES


Usernames  have  a  profile in the Master  User  Directory  (MUD)
which,  among  other  things, limits from where a user may access
the network and to  where  they may call. The profile may custom-
define a set origination points or may use  one  or  more  of the
predefined Classes.

There  are limits on the complexity of  a  username  profile.  An
access position can have a maximum of six  entries  defining both
the origination and destinations allowed.  Each username may have
at  most 10 access positions.  These  limits  rarely  create  any
difficulty.

The order in which the access positions of a username are defined
is important: the Supervisor will always try to  satisfy  a logon
request  using  access  positions  in  order  (top  to bottom  as
displayed  by  VALINFO).  A   customer   with   two  hosts  in  a
primary/backup configuration requesting access from two different
Class locations would have usernames requiring 4 access positions
(2x2=4).


5  STANDARD USERNAME PROFILES


The following shows the Classes of access issued as standard with
particular types of usernames.

    o  DEFAULT:  Class 4.

    o  OUTBOUND USERNAMES:  Class 35.  Class 69 may be added with
       the prior permission of International Network Services.

    o  PUBLIC ASYNC OUTDIAL: Class  35,  36, 67 and 28.  Group 44
       is the standard set of destination hosts.

    o  X.121 ADDRESSES OF THE "9" FORMAT: Class 1 and Class 36.

       All Digits after the DNIC form a numeric username (Network
       User Number)

6  GROUPS


In  a  similar  fashion to the way  a  CLASS  defines  a  set  of
origination points (nodes or hosts), a GROUP defines a    set  of
destination points (hosts).

The username  profile uses GROUPS to efficiently describe the set
of  allowed  destinations  for the username.   Defining  a  group
simplifies username management, especially where the set of hosts
is large and constantly changing.

     NOTE: It is a  misconception  that  a TYMNET Supervisor will
     consider ALL members of a GROUP when selecting a destination
     for  a  user  which  did  not (or cannot) specify their  own
     choice of host by using the "colon option".

     Currently, the Supervisor will select from the last fourteen
     (14)  hosts  of  the  GROUP  as  it  is   defined   in  that
     Supervisor's  GROUP tables.  Only if NONE  of  the  last  14
     members of  the  group  are  available  will  the Supervisor
     examine the next batch of up to 14 hosts from the  bottom of
     the  GROUP.    Among  the  subset chosen, the  selection  of
     destination is based upon  host  status  and least cost path
     calculations.   For this reason, GROUPs are of limited value
     in load balancing between hosts.


The following describes the main Groups used by the TYMNET public
network:-

GROUP     DESCRIPTION

0         All hosts in the network.

2         TYMSHARE hosts.

19        Hosts that require access with X.121  addresses  of the
          format  3106+0+hhhhh+ssss.    All  X.75  gateways  have
          group 19  access.  X.25 hosts that request public X.121
          access may also have group 19 access (add  group  19 to
          the x25hhhhh username).

          This "0" format  will  be  implemented  by  a different
          mechanism  with  the  upcoming  TYMNET Numbering Plan 2
          (TNP2) enhancements to  the TYMNET numbering plan. TNP2
          will  make  the  current  use  of  Group  19  obsolete.
          However, Group 19 will continue to exist  until further
          announcement.

37        A special group which  enables  the  user to access the
          Supervisor's Target Profile  table.  The Target Profile

          Private Operating Agency (RPOA) selection  capabilities
          to outbound users and X.25 hosts.

          Recognized  Private  Operating  Agencies  (RPOAs)   are
          transit  networks   that   may   be   used   to   carry
          international   calls   between   the  origination  and
          destination networks.

7  CLASS DESCRIPTIONS


The  following  gives  a  "plain  English"  description   of  the
principal  Classes  used  to  control  access  to  public  TYMNET
services.  See  the  section  of  Class  definitions  for  a more
rigorous definition on of each of the Classes.

The descriptions in conjuction with  the  definitions  and tables
below, should assist  TYMNET  personnel in catering to the access
requirements of new and existing customers.

The term "gateway" is much over worked and may  refer  to  almost
any  network  interface.   In this document  the  term  "gateway"
refers  to the interface (T2 or X.75)  between  two  PUBLIC  Data
Networks (PDNs).


Class 1.       TITLE: Caller paid (prepaid) gateways.

               DESCRIPTION:    gateways  for which inbound access
               charges are paid by the calling party.


Class 2.       TITLE: McDonnell Douglas in-house usernames.

               DESCRIPTION:    Most  locations except private and
               PTT subnetworks.

               Network Marketing - for example during betatest of
               a new public access product.   TymDial  was barred
               from 4 during betatest and now is  permitted since
               the product is in  full  release  and  the service

8  DEFINITION OF CLASSES


In the following definitions, reference  is  often  made  to "the
rates quoted for"    and  then  either  "low  density  cities" or
"WATS".  The comparison of access rates is made by  comparing the
cost  of  a  1  hour  session  with  70K  characters of I/O using
standard pricing (not file transfer  pricing)  with  no discounts
applied.

At current prices, these values are:-

               Time      +    I/O       =    Total
Low density    11.45     +    4.20      =    $15.65
WATS           23.20     +    4.20      =    $27.40

8.1  CHANGES TO DEFINITIONS

Definitions are subject to periodic  review  and  may  be changed
after  careful consideration  and  consultation  as  appropriate.
Changes are made cautiously since it may be difficult to restrict
access where once it was possible.

Occasionally,   the   scope   of   particular  Class  may  become
inconsistent with its definition.  This is most  likely  to occur




                             - 12 -






where the definition is based upon a dollar value or  is relative
to the price of certain "benchmark" services (eg: WATS).

As a "rule of thumb",  where Class barriers are based principally
upon pricing, a service  or  location's price may drift up to 20%
from  the  Class's  normal benchmark (eg: low  density  or  WATS)
before action is initiated to remove that location/service from a
Class's composition.

In all cases, the principle is to keep consistent with the spirit
of a Class's definition while  not  annoying  our  subscribers by
being  over zealous in changing host  access  due  to  relatively
minor fluctuations in the network pricing structure.

Where adjustments that will curtail the scope of a Class's access
become necessary, notice is  typically  given  to  TYMNET support
groups in advance.  Where possible, username profiles are updated
to  keep changes transparent to the  majority  of  users.  TYMNET
Validations reserves the right to change the Class tables without
prior notice.


9  COMPARING ACCESS CHARGES


To make a true comparison of the cost of services  from different
locations, it is necessary to compare the cost of a  session with
both a connect time and I/O component.

The benchmark used is -  1  hour  of  connect  time  with  an I/O
component of 70K Characters occurring during the peak rate period
with  no  special  discounts  applied.    Traffic  statistics and
projections reveal that 70KCh is a suitable I/O benchmark for  at
least the next two or three years.

The table below gives dollar comparisons of selected locations at
the prevailing rates and indicates  the scope of access for Class
4 and Class 24.

NOTE(#):  Pricing of this service is made in Kilo-Segments so for
purpose of comparison we have  converted  segments  to characters
assuming 60% segment fill.    1Kseg*60%  = 38,400 characters. 60%
segment  fill  is  a  realistic  segment  fill  for an  'average'
session.  Actual usage  may  deviate  significantly  from average
depending on the nature of the application.
